## Client Options
### `client_option()`, `client_option(player, option, value)`

## Client Shaders
### `client_shaders(player, namespace?, value)`

Sends a custom packet to the `player` to ask its client to set a specific Shader as post shader.

Shaders will be loaded from `<[namespace]|minecraft>:shaders/post/<value>.json`.

It requires the mod on the client too.
